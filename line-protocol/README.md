# line-protocol

## contributing
In order to make this package nicely and comfortably importable by outside projects do not make this package dependent on the rest of platform.
Generally try to limit dependencies in this package.


## todo:
 [x] Make a serializer that uses a similar pattern to a `json.Encoder`
 [ ] Make an easily exposed io.Reader interface for things that need that.
